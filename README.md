## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/college_act_charts.git
cd college_act_charts

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Data Sources

- **IPEDS** (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System): Cost, enrollment, graduation rates, institutional characteristics, distance education
- **IPEDS Completions**: Program-level completions data (C2024_a.csv) for program count analysis
- **Federal Student Aid**: Federal loan and Pell grant totals by institution (2008-2022)
- **College Scorecard**: Median earnings data for ROI analysis
- **U.S. Census ACS**: High school baseline earnings for ROI calculations
- **Earnings Premium Analysis**: State median earnings thresholds, institutional earnings medians, enrollment data

All data sources are documented in `data/dictionary/sources.yaml` with update procedures and provenance tracking.

## Development

### Data Processing

Regenerate processed Parquet files from CSV sources:

```bash
python -m src.data.datasets
```

Build Earnings Premium metrics and program counts:

```bash
# Build program counts from IPEDS completions
python src/data/build_program_counts.py

# Build EP metrics dataset (includes program counts)
python src/data/build_ep_metrics.py
```

Build ROI datasets:

```bash
# Build ROI OPEID mapping
python src/data/build_roi_opeid_mapping.py

# Build ROI metrics dataset
python src/data/build_roi_metrics.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint with ruff
ruff check .

# Format with black
black src

# Run tests
pytest -q
```

## Version History

See [LOG.md](LOG.md) for detailed changelog.

**Current Version**: v0.8 - Comprehensive dashboard with 8 major sections including advanced Earnings Premium Analysis with 9 sub-pages, 6,000+ institutions, program-level tracking (~165,000 programs), and complete state/sector/risk analysis capabilities.

## Technical Notes

### Processed Data
- Files: Multiple Parquet files including `tuition_vs_graduation.parquet`, `ep_analysis.parquet` (6,429 institutions), `program_counts.parquet` (3,936 institutions), `roi_metrics.parquet` (327 CA institutions), and federal aid datasets
- Compression: Snappy via `DataFrame.to_parquet(..., compression="snappy")` balances size and load speed
- Column dtypes: `UnitID`/`enrollment`/`year` ‚Üí `Int32`, `cost`/`graduation_rate` ‚Üí `float32`, `sector`/`state` ‚Üí pandas `category`, and `institution` ‚Üí pandas `string`
- Cache versioning: `DATA_VERSION = "parquet_v1"` in `src/data/datasets.py` scopes Streamlit's `st.cache_data` to current Parquet schema
- Regeneration: Run `python -m src.data.datasets` to rebuild Parquet (falls back to CSV, validates counts/stats, and overwrites Parquet outputs)
