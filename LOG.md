| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-10-28 | Add aggregate Pell grant dollars trend chart | Adds "Pell Dollars Trend (Total)" analysis showing aggregate Pell grant patterns across all institutions per year (2008-2022). Features dotted line with purple styling (#9467bd matching Pell theme), colored dots indicating year-over-year change direction (green=increase >0.5%, gray=same ±0.5%, red=decrease <-0.5%), interactive tooltips with YoY percentage changes, and tab-based navigation for 4-year vs 2-year sectors. Updated Pell Grants Overview to show 4 analysis types (was 3) with new purple-styled analysis card. Implemented _prepare_pell_trend_total_dataframe() for aggregation logic and render_pell_trend_total_chart() for Altair visualization. Added PELL_TREND_TOTAL_LABEL constant and routing logic. Updated README.md to reflect aggregate trend analysis capabilities. **Use case**: Reveals macro-level need-based aid trends like post-2008 expansion, sequestration impacts, and sector-wide access patterns not visible in per-institution charts. | `src/charts/pell_trend_total_chart.py` (new, 239 lines), `src/sections/pell_grants.py:12,20,78,89,133-145,198-199,301-322`, `src/config/constants.py:66,73`, `src/config/__init__.py:24`, `README.md:30-36` |
| 2025-10-28 | Add aggregate federal loan dollars trend chart | Adds "Federal Loan Dollars Trend (Total)" analysis showing aggregate lending patterns across all institutions per year (2008-2022). Features dotted line with steelblue styling (#1f77b4), colored dots indicating year-over-year change direction (green=increase >0.5%, gray=same ±0.5%, red=decrease <-0.5%), interactive tooltips with YoY percentage changes, and tab-based navigation for 4-year vs 2-year sectors. Updated Federal Loans Overview to show 4 analysis types (was 3) with new purple-styled analysis card. Implemented _prepare_loan_trend_total_dataframe() for aggregation logic and render_loan_trend_total_chart() for Altair visualization. Added LOAN_TREND_TOTAL_LABEL constant and routing logic. Updated README.md to reflect aggregate trend analysis capabilities. **Use case**: Reveals macro-level lending trends like post-2008 recovery, COVID-era impacts, and sector-wide borrowing patterns not visible in per-institution charts. | `src/charts/loan_trend_total_chart.py` (new, 239 lines), `src/sections/federal_loans.py:11,19,74,85,129-145,200,276-307`, `src/config/constants.py:89,95`, `src/config/__init__.py:35`, `README.md:22-28` |
| 2025-10-27 | Fix Altair chart width parameter error | Corrected TypeError in Altair charts caused by incorrect `width="stretch"` parameter. **Root cause**: October 26th commit mistakenly applied dataframe/Plotly parameter syntax to Altair charts. Different Streamlit chart types use different parameters: st.dataframe() uses `width="stretch"`, st.plotly_chart() uses `use_container_width=True`, and st.altair_chart() uses `use_container_width=True` (NOT `width`). Fixed render_altair_chart() function signature from `width: str = "stretch"` to `use_container_width: bool = True`. Updated all 28 call sites across 16 files to remove invalid `width="stretch"` parameter, relying on default `use_container_width=True`. **Error location**: College Explorer > Graduation Rates page (line 835) and all other Altair chart pages. **Result**: Eliminates TypeError "VegaChartsMixin.altair_chart() got an unexpected keyword argument 'width'"; all Altair charts now render correctly with full container width using proper Streamlit 1.50.0 API. | `src/ui/renderers.py:10-12`, `src/sections/college_explorer.py:835,1240,1308`, `src/charts/cost_vs_grad_chart.py:176`, `src/charts/roi_quadrant_chart.py:137`, `src/charts/roi_rankings_chart.py:129`, `src/charts/roi_distribution_chart.py:128`, `src/charts/distance_enrollment_trend_chart.py:318,388`, `src/charts/distance_de_trend_chart.py:375,441`, `src/charts/distance_top_enrollment_chart.py:286`, `src/charts/pell_top_dollars_chart.py:247`, `src/charts/pell_trend_chart.py:164`, `src/charts/pell_vs_grad_scatter_chart.py:115`, `src/charts/pell_grad_rate_scatter_chart.py:110`, `src/charts/loan_top_dollars_chart.py:202`, `src/charts/loan_trend_chart.py:242`, `src/charts/loan_vs_grad_scatter_chart.py:151` |
| 2025-10-27 | Enhance EP Analysis Program Distribution page with institution count and reorder navigation | Added "Number of Institutions" metric (3,936) as first of 5 Key Metrics cards on Program Distribution page, providing context before displaying program-level statistics. Expanded layout from 4 columns to 5 columns with new metric showing institutions with program-level completions data. Reordered EP Analysis sidebar navigation to place Program Distribution (position 6) before Institution Lookup (position 7), creating better logical flow: Overview → Risk Distribution → Risk Map → Risk Quadrants → Sector Comparison → State Analysis → Program Distribution → Institution Lookup → Methodology & Limitations. This progression moves from scale analysis to individual institution lookup, maintaining intuitive navigation hierarchy. **Result**: Enhanced Program Distribution page provides complete picture from institutions → programs → assessment scale; improved sidebar navigation places system-wide analysis before individual lookups. Minor whitespace cleanup in app.py (no functional change). | `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:1212,1218-1259`, `src/config/navigation.py:203-212`, `app.py:48` |
| 2025-10-26 | Fix Plotly chart deprecation warnings | Corrected st.plotly_chart() calls from incorrect width="stretch" to proper use_container_width=True parameter. Previous commit (Oct 26, "Fix Streamlit use_container_width deprecation warnings") mistakenly applied dataframe/Altair width parameter syntax to Plotly charts, causing **kwargs deprecation warnings ("keyword arguments have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use config instead"). Plotly charts use use_container_width (boolean), not width parameter. Fixed 8 occurrences across earnings_premium_analysis.py (7) and roi_timeline_chart.py (1). **Result**: Eliminates all Plotly deprecation warnings without changing chart rendering behavior. Charts still render at full container width as intended. **Root cause**: Different chart types in Streamlit have different parameter names—st.plotly_chart() uses use_container_width, while st.dataframe() and Altair charts use width. | `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:288,492,752,990,1155,1293,1355`, `src/charts/roi_timeline_chart.py:115` |
| 2025-10-26 | Add Program Distribution tab to EP Analysis section | Implemented comprehensive Program Distribution page visualizing the scale of program-level Earnings Premium requirements (~165,000 programs across 3,900+ institutions). Created build_program_counts.py to process IPEDS completions data (C2024_a.csv), filtering to EP-relevant programs (6-digit CIP codes, Associate/Bachelor's/Master's/Doctoral levels, first majors only) and calculating unique program counts per institution. Generated program_counts.parquet with total_programs, assessable_programs (sufficient completers), total_completions, and avg_completions_per_program columns. Updated build_ep_metrics.py with add_program_counts() function to merge program data into EP analysis pipeline. Enhanced earnings_premium_analysis.py with _render_program_distribution() method (310 lines) featuring: summary metrics (4 cards), program distribution histogram (7 bins), sector breakdown (horizontal bar + table), top 25 institutions table with 3-year data points, and data collection challenge explainer. Updated navigation.py to add Program Distribution button between Institution Lookup and Methodology. Page presents data objectively using "show, don't tell" approach with neutral tone. Key findings: 165,649 total programs, 47,658 assessable programs (29%), median 27 programs per institution, largest portfolio 562 programs, 27× more data points than institutional tracking. Fixed file format issue (comma-delimited not space-delimited), handled BOM encoding (utf-8-sig), converted CIPCODE to string for regex matching. | `src/data/build_program_counts.py` (new, 254 lines), `src/data/build_ep_metrics.py:279-322,330-331,380`, `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:20,174-175,1161-1471,1334`, `src/config/constants.py:133,143`, `src/config/navigation.py:34,208-212`, `data/processed/program_counts.parquet` (new), `data/processed/ep_analysis.parquet` (updated with program columns) |
| 2025-10-26 | Reorder EP Analysis navigation for improved user flow | Reorganized Earnings Premium Analysis sidebar navigation buttons to create a more logical progression through analysis tools. **New order**: Overview → Risk Distribution → Risk Map → Risk Quadrants → Sector Comparison → State Analysis → Institution Lookup → Methodology & Limitations. **Rationale**: Groups visualization tools together (Risk Map, Risk Quadrants) followed by comparison tools (Sector, State) before individual lookup, creating a natural flow from broad overview to specific details. Moved Risk Quadrants from position 6 to position 3, Sector Comparison from position 5 to position 4, State Analysis from position 4 to position 5, and Institution Lookup from position 3 to position 6. **Result**: Improved user experience with intuitive navigation flow; no functional changes to any pages; all routing logic works unchanged via label matching. | `src/config/navigation.py:176-212` |
| 2025-10-26 | Fix Streamlit use_container_width deprecation warnings | Replaced all deprecated `use_container_width` parameters with new `width` parameter throughout codebase to eliminate 17 deprecation warnings. **Changes**: Replaced `use_container_width=True` with `width="stretch"` in app.py navigation buttons (3 occurrences), earnings_premium_analysis.py plotly_chart and dataframe calls (10 occurrences), college_explorer.py dataframe call (1 occurrence), and roi_timeline_chart.py plotly_chart call (1 occurrence). Simplified src/ui/renderers.py by removing backwards-compatibility try/except blocks and obsolete `use_container_width` fallbacks, now using `width` parameter directly in render_altair_chart() and render_dataframe() functions. **Result**: Clean console output with no deprecation warnings; future-proofed for Streamlit versions after 2025-12-31; no functional changes to UI rendering behavior; all charts and dataframes render identically with new parameter. | `app.py:51,66,80`, `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:264,331,468,665,728,838,966,1033,1131,1192`, `src/sections/college_explorer.py:1325`, `src/charts/roi_timeline_chart.py:115`, `src/ui/renderers.py:1,10-17` |
| 2025-10-26 | Rename EP risk classifications to 4-level system | Renamed all Earnings Premium risk classifications from "Critical/High/Moderate/Low Risk" to "High/Moderate/Low/Very Low Risk" for clearer terminology. **Mapping**: Critical Risk (margin <0%) → High Risk; High Risk (0-20%) → Moderate Risk; Moderate Risk (20-50%) → Low Risk; Low Risk (>50%) → Very Low Risk. **Changes**: Updated risk categorization logic in build_ep_metrics.py with new return values and risk_level_map; regenerated ep_analysis.parquet with 6,429 institutions (distribution: Very Low 1,829, Low 1,422, Moderate 885, High 1,264, No Data 1,029); updated all UI displays across 6 EP Analysis pages including Overview risk definition cards, Risk Distribution tabs, Risk Map filters, State Analysis, Sector Comparison, and Risk Quadrants; updated color mappings to maintain consistency (green=Very Low, blue=Low, orange=Moderate, red=High); changed "At Risk" definition from "High+Critical" to "Moderate+High"; renamed summary metrics from "Critical Risk" to "High Risk" and "critical_count" to "high_risk_count"; updated ep_data_loader.py at_risk calculations in get_risk_summary(), get_sector_summary(), and get_national_summary(); updated test files with new valid_risk_levels set; updated all filter options, smart sorting logic, and help text throughout dashboard. **Result**: More intuitive risk naming with "High Risk" as worst category instead of "Critical Risk"; maintains same margin thresholds and institution assignments; all visualizations and data exports reflect new terminology. | `src/data/build_ep_metrics.py:228-250`, `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:87-130,212,243-249,289,308-310,380-384,418-423,547-553,711-717,780,807-811,948-953,990,1064`, `src/core/ep_data_loader.py:104-105,177,333-334,361-362`, `tests/test_ep_calculations.py:234`, `data/processed/ep_analysis.parquet` |
| 2025-10-26 | Refine EP Analysis navigation and add Risk Distribution institution lists | Completed comprehensive refactoring of Earnings Premium Analysis section with improved navigation and enhanced Risk Distribution page. **Navigation improvements**: Renamed sidebar buttons from "National Overview" to "Risk Distribution" and "Overview & Risk Map" to "Risk Map" for clarity; updated page titles to match sidebar labels; updated get_available_charts() to include EP_NATIONAL_OVERVIEW_LABEL for proper routing. **Risk Distribution page enhancements**: Added 5 tabs (Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Critical Risk, No Data) below bar chart displaying complete institution lists for each risk category; each tab shows institution count, sortable data table with 7 columns (Institution, State, Median Earnings, State Threshold, Margin %, Sector, Enrollment), smart sorting (best performers first for Low/Moderate, worst first for High/Critical), and CSV download button; removed sector/state filters for cleaner UI; changed section header from "Risk Distribution" to "Institution Count by Risk Level" and removed redundant Plotly chart title. **Result**: Clear separation of Overview (educational content only) vs Risk Distribution (metrics + institution data); improved navigation consistency with concise, descriptive labels; complete institution transparency with downloadable lists by risk category; cleaner UI with single title and no redundant filters. Implementation: 80+ lines of tab-based institution lists, label constant updates, page title synchronization, routing fix in get_available_charts(). | `src/config/constants.py:127-128`, `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:14,179-180,235,256-262,280-373,361-362,1260` |
| 2025-10-25 | Add Risk Quadrants page to EP Analysis section | Implemented comprehensive Risk Quadrants visualization page with 4 tabs for detailed risk-based analysis of institutional earnings vs state thresholds. Each tab (Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, Critical Risk) displays scatter plot with X-axis = State threshold, Y-axis = Median earnings, color coding by sector (6 distinct colors matching other EP pages), reference line (y=x diagonal) showing earnings = threshold boundary, interactive hover tooltips with institution details (Name, State, Sector, Earnings, Threshold, Margin %), and summary metrics (Median Earnings, Median Threshold, Avg Margin %). Risk category breakdown: Low Risk 1,829 institutions (Margin > 50%), Moderate Risk 1,422 institutions (Margin 20-50%), High Risk 885 institutions (Margin 0-20%), Critical Risk 1,264 institutions (Margin < 0%). Visualization helps identify patterns in risk distribution across sectors and states, enabling targeted analysis of institutions near threshold boundaries. Implementation: Added EP_RISK_QUADRANTS_LABEL constant, updated navigation config with description "Scatter plots by risk category with sector colors", created _render_risk_quadrants() method (110 lines), updated render_chart() router, and added to get_available_charts() list. All 6 EP Analysis pages now complete. | `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:11,256-257,949-1058,1226-1235`, `src/config/constants.py:131,140`, `src/config/navigation.py:30,196-200`, `src/config/__init__.py:125` |
| 2025-10-25 | Improve Sector Comparison with comprehensive tab-based institution lists | Enhanced Sector Comparison page by replacing limited dropdown "Sector Deep Dive" (showing only top/bottom 10) with comprehensive tab-based view displaying ALL institutions in each sector. Created 6 sector tabs (For-profit/Private nonprofit/Public × 4yr/2yr) with complete institution lists: Public 4-year (777), Private nonprofit 4-year (1,283), For-profit 4-year (195), Public 2-year (786), Private nonprofit 2-year (63), For-profit 2-year (127). Each tab features institution count display, risk level multiselect filter, sortable/filterable data table with 7 columns (Institution, State, Median Earnings, State Threshold, Margin %, Risk Level, Enrollment), default sort by earnings margin descending (best performers first), and CSV download button for sector-specific data export. Tables display complete sector composition with proper formatting (currency with commas, percentages with 1 decimal). Improved user experience: complete sector visibility vs limited extremes, easier navigation with tabs vs dropdown, more informative columns including state threshold, sector-specific data export capability. Implementation: +77 lines replacing -33 lines of old dropdown code. Fixed Institution Lookup page TypeError by converting STABBR category dtype to string before concatenation (astype(str)). | `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:354,817-892` |
| 2025-10-25 | **Phase 2: State Analysis & Sector Comparison Pages** | Completed full Earnings Premium Analysis section with all 6 pages. Phase 2 adds comprehensive state-level and sector-level risk analysis. State Analysis page features state selector (50 states + DC + National Overview), state summary card with threshold ranking (e.g., "#8 highest nationally"), 3 metric cards (Institutions/Median Earnings/Avg Margin), risk distribution breakdown, filterable/sortable institutions table (by sector/risk), state vs national comparison table, and CSV download. National Overview shows summary statistics and risk distribution chart. Sector Comparison page features 6 sector overview cards in 2x3 grid (Public/Private/For-Profit × 4yr/2yr) color-coded by risk level (red >50%, orange >30%, green ≤30%), grouped bar chart showing risk distribution across sectors, sector deep dive with dropdown selector, and side-by-side top 10/bottom 10 performers tables. Enhanced data layer with get_national_summary() (cached national statistics), get_all_states() (59 states/territories), get_all_sectors() (6 sector types). Added EP_STATE_ANALYSIS_LABEL and EP_SECTOR_COMPARISON_LABEL constants, updated navigation with descriptions. Implementation: ~350 lines State Analysis, ~140 lines Sector Comparison, ~60 lines enhanced data loaders. Consistent styling with Phase 1C (gradient cards, color-coded risk levels). All 6 pages now complete: Overview, Overview & Risk Map, Institution Lookup, State Analysis (new), Sector Comparison (new), Methodology & Limitations. Validated with real data: 5,400 institutions nationally (39.8% at risk), California 672 institutions (threshold $32,476), Public 4-year 777 institutions (7.3% at risk). | `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py:514-858` (+345 lines), `src/core/ep_data_loader.py:340-397` (+58 lines), `src/config/constants.py:129-131,137-139`, `src/config/navigation.py:30-31,185-194`, `src/config/__init__.py:123-124` |
| 2025-10-25 | **Phase 1C: Earnings Premium Analysis MVP UI** | Implemented complete Section 9: Earnings Premium Analysis with three pages assessing institutional readiness for July 1, 2026 EP requirements. Created comprehensive 700-line section class with Overview page (national summary statistics, risk distribution bar chart), Overview & Risk Map page (interactive Plotly scatter plot showing 6,429 institutions' earnings vs state thresholds with filters by risk level/sector/state, CSV download), Institution Lookup page (searchable dropdown, detailed risk assessment cards with color-coded borders, peer comparison tables showing 5 similar institutions by state/sector/enrollment), and Methodology & Limitations page (data sources table, risk calculation formula, example calculations, critical disclaimers about institution-level vs program-level analysis). Replaced old California-only EP section with national analysis. Updated navigation with 3 MVP chart configs (Phase 2 will add State Analysis and Sector Comparison). Risk categorization uses margin thresholds: Low (>50%), Moderate (20-50%), High (0-20%), Critical (<0%). All pages feature prominent limitation warnings that actual EP testing occurs at program level using IRS/SSA data. Data integration uses load_ep_data() and get_risk_summary() from ep_data_loader.py (committed in Phase 1B). Current risk distribution: 28.4% Low, 22.1% Moderate, 13.8% High, 19.7% Critical, 16.0% No Data across 5,400 institutions with assessments. Chart styling matches existing dashboard patterns with gradient hero sections, color-coded risk indicators (green/blue/orange/red), and comprehensive tooltips. | `src/sections/earnings_premium_analysis.py` (700 lines, new), `src/config/constants.py:125-140`, `src/config/navigation.py:28-30,163-191`, `src/config/__init__.py:121-125`, `src/sections/__init__.py:9`, `.gitignore:10-11` |
| 2025-10-25 | Add UI-configurable enrollment filter to College Value Grid | Implemented user-configurable enrollment filtering with radio buttons offering 5 options: All (>0), >500, >1,000 (default), >5,000, >10,000. Changed both 4-year and 2-year charts to default to 1,000 minimum enrollment (previously 4-year used 1,000, 2-year used 0). Filter selection persists via session state and dynamically updates chart captions and warnings. Added ENROLLMENT_FILTER_OPTIONS and DEFAULT_ENROLLMENT_FILTER constants, created _render_enrollment_filter() method in ValueGridSection, and enhanced chart caption formatting to show "all enrollment levels" when filter ≤ 1. | `src/config/constants.py:38,42-44,155`, `src/config/__init__.py:17-18,85-86`, `src/sections/value_grid.py:15-18,20,150-190,208`, `src/charts/cost_vs_grad_chart.py:32-40,155-168` |
| 2025-10-24 | **Release v1.0 - Production Ready** | First production release of EDU Accountability Lab dashboard. Includes 8 major sections (Overview, College Value Grid, Federal Loans, Pell Grants, Distance Education, Earnings Premium, ROI, College Explorer) with 6,000+ institutions, comprehensive visualizations, and tab-based navigation. Ready for public deployment with complete documentation, proper branding, and clear data scope limitations. | All files |
| 2025-10-24 | Pre-launch improvements: quadrant legend, scope warning, README, page config | Added quadrant legend to ROI Cost vs Earnings chart matching College Value Grid format (Top-Left = High Earnings Low Cost, etc.). Added prominent warning callout in ROI Overview section clarifying California 2-year institution scope (no UC/CSU systems). Completely rewrote README.md with project description, features list, quick start guide, data sources, project structure, and development instructions. Added Streamlit page config to app.py with branded title "EDU Accountability Lab", 📊 icon, wide layout, and About menu text. | `src/charts/roi_quadrant_chart.py`, `src/sections/roi.py`, `README.md`, `app.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Reorganize ROI Cost vs Earnings Quadrant data presentation with tabs | Restructured data display to match College Value Grid format with four tabs representing each quadrant (High Earnings Low Cost, High Earnings High Cost, Low Earnings Low Cost, Low Earnings High Cost). Replaced single table listing all institutions with tab-based navigation showing institution count and sorted tables within each quadrant. Tables display Institution, County, Sector, Net Price, Earnings, ROI years, and ROI months, sorted by ROI (best first) within each quadrant. Added custom CSS for larger tab fonts. Removed separate "Quadrant Summary" table as tab structure provides clearer organization. | `src/charts/roi_quadrant_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Change ROI Cost vs Earnings Quadrant coloring from ROI years to Sector | Modified scatter plot to color points by sector (Public/Private nonprofit/Private for-profit) instead of ROI years. Uses existing SECTOR_COLOR_SCALE (green for Public, purple for Private nonprofit, blue for Private for-profit). ROI information still available in tooltips. Updated caption to reflect sector-based coloring. This change makes sector patterns more visible in the cost vs earnings relationship. | `src/charts/roi_quadrant_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Remove Year-over-Year Change legend from College Explorer Distance Education chart | Added `legend=None` to the ChangeDirection color encoding in the points layer to hide the Year-over-Year Change legend (Increase, Same, Decrease). The color indicators still appear on data points and change direction information remains available in tooltips, but the redundant legend is now hidden for cleaner chart presentation. | `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Fix College Explorer Distance Education data display for 100% distance institutions | Modified data extraction logic to handle institutions with 100% exclusive distance education where `SDE_ENROLL_TOTAL` is empty. The code now gracefully handles missing `SDE_ENROLL_TOTAL` values by defaulting to 0, allowing institutions like Western Governors University (282,150 students, 100% distance education) to display correctly. Previously, empty `SDE_ENROLL_TOTAL` caused ValueError triggering "unavailable" message despite complete data. Only requires `TOTAL_ENROLL_2024` and `DE_ENROLL_2024` to be present; calculates "On Campus / Hybrid" as difference. | `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Fix redundant title text in College Value Grid charts | Updated Value Grid chart labels in constants to include "Rate" (from "Cost vs Graduation (4-year)" to "Cost vs Graduation Rate (4-year)") and simplified chart title rendering to use label directly instead of wrapping it with redundant text. This eliminates the display of "Cost vs. Graduation Rate (Cost vs Graduation (4-year))" and shows clean title "Cost vs Graduation Rate (4-year)". Same fix applied to 2-year charts. Navigation labels now more descriptive. | `src/config/constants.py`, `src/charts/cost_vs_grad_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Apply College Explorer line chart style to Distance Education trend charts | Replaced dotted lines with solid bold lines (`strokeWidth=3`) and separate colored circles with integrated filled points (`point=alt.OverlayMarkDef(size=100, filled=True)`) to match the professional styling used in College Explorer Federal Loans and Pell Grants charts. Simplified from two-layer charts (lines + points with dual color scales) to single-layer charts with cleaner appearance. Year-over-year change information still available in tooltips but removed from visual encoding for clearer presentation. Updated captions to reflect new style. Applied to both Total Enrollment Trend and Exclusive Distance Education Trend charts. | `src/charts/distance_enrollment_trend_chart.py`, `src/charts/distance_de_trend_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Add stacked bar chart to College Explorer Distance Education page | Added stacked bar visualization below the line chart on the Distance Education institution search page, showing enrollment composition breakdown (Exclusive Distance + On Campus/Hybrid = Total Enrollment) by year. Chart displays only the two components that sum to total, with orange for Exclusive Distance and green for On Campus/Hybrid. Y-axis shows Total Enrollment with ~s formatting for clean SI prefix labels. Page now features: line chart (trends with YoY changes), stacked bar chart (composition view), and data table (exact values). | `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Move Institution Distance Search to College Explorer section | Relocated "Institution Distance Search" functionality from Distance Education section to College Explorer section and renamed it to "Distance Education" for better organizational consistency. All institution-level analysis now consolidated under College Explorer (Summary, Federal Loans & Pell Grants, Graduation Rates, Distance Education). Removed method from Distance Education section, which now contains only aggregate trend charts (Top 25, Total Enrollment Trend, Exclusive DE Trend). | `src/sections/college_explorer.py`, `src/sections/distance_education.py`, `src/config/constants.py`, `src/config/__init__.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Enhance Distance Education trend charts with stacked bar visualizations | Removed duplicate Year-over-Year Change legends from both trend charts. Added stacked bar charts underneath line charts for Total Enrollment Trend and Exclusive Distance Education Trend, providing market composition view complementing individual trajectory analysis. Replaced percentage line chart in Exclusive DE Trend with stacked bar. Fixed y-axis formatting from `.1s` to `~s` to eliminate duplicate labels and scientific notation, providing clean SI prefix labels (200k, 1M, 1.2M). Both charts now feature: line chart (trajectories + YoY changes), stacked bar chart (market composition), and data table (exact values). | `src/charts/distance_enrollment_trend_chart.py`, `src/charts/distance_de_trend_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-19 | Refine College Value Grid overview narrative | Annotated each quadrant directly within the illustrative grid, added adjacent callouts, removed redundant reading/how-to sections, and tuned typography/colors for clearer value framing. | `src/sections/value_grid.py` |
