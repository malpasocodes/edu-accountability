# Change Log

| Date | Change | Details | Files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-10-24 | Change ROI Cost vs Earnings Quadrant coloring from ROI years to Sector | Modified scatter plot to color points by sector (Public/Private nonprofit/Private for-profit) instead of ROI years. Uses existing SECTOR_COLOR_SCALE (green for Public, purple for Private nonprofit, blue for Private for-profit). ROI information still available in tooltips. Updated caption to reflect sector-based coloring. This change makes sector patterns more visible in the cost vs earnings relationship. | `src/charts/roi_quadrant_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Remove Year-over-Year Change legend from College Explorer Distance Education chart | Added `legend=None` to the ChangeDirection color encoding in the points layer to hide the Year-over-Year Change legend (Increase, Same, Decrease). The color indicators still appear on data points and change direction information remains available in tooltips, but the redundant legend is now hidden for cleaner chart presentation. | `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Fix College Explorer Distance Education data display for 100% distance institutions | Modified data extraction logic to handle institutions with 100% exclusive distance education where `SDE_ENROLL_TOTAL` is empty. The code now gracefully handles missing `SDE_ENROLL_TOTAL` values by defaulting to 0, allowing institutions like Western Governors University (282,150 students, 100% distance education) to display correctly. Previously, empty `SDE_ENROLL_TOTAL` caused ValueError triggering "unavailable" message despite complete data. Only requires `TOTAL_ENROLL_2024` and `DE_ENROLL_2024` to be present; calculates "On Campus / Hybrid" as difference. | `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Fix redundant title text in College Value Grid charts | Updated Value Grid chart labels in constants to include "Rate" (from "Cost vs Graduation (4-year)" to "Cost vs Graduation Rate (4-year)") and simplified chart title rendering to use label directly instead of wrapping it with redundant text. This eliminates the display of "Cost vs. Graduation Rate (Cost vs Graduation (4-year))" and shows clean title "Cost vs Graduation Rate (4-year)". Same fix applied to 2-year charts. Navigation labels now more descriptive. | `src/config/constants.py`, `src/charts/cost_vs_grad_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Apply College Explorer line chart style to Distance Education trend charts | Replaced dotted lines with solid bold lines (`strokeWidth=3`) and separate colored circles with integrated filled points (`point=alt.OverlayMarkDef(size=100, filled=True)`) to match the professional styling used in College Explorer Federal Loans and Pell Grants charts. Simplified from two-layer charts (lines + points with dual color scales) to single-layer charts with cleaner appearance. Year-over-year change information still available in tooltips but removed from visual encoding for clearer presentation. Updated captions to reflect new style. Applied to both Total Enrollment Trend and Exclusive Distance Education Trend charts. | `src/charts/distance_enrollment_trend_chart.py`, `src/charts/distance_de_trend_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Add stacked bar chart to College Explorer Distance Education page | Added stacked bar visualization below the line chart on the Distance Education institution search page, showing enrollment composition breakdown (Exclusive Distance + On Campus/Hybrid = Total Enrollment) by year. Chart displays only the two components that sum to total, with orange for Exclusive Distance and green for On Campus/Hybrid. Y-axis shows Total Enrollment with ~s formatting for clean SI prefix labels. Page now features: line chart (trends with YoY changes), stacked bar chart (composition view), and data table (exact values). | `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Move Institution Distance Search to College Explorer section | Relocated "Institution Distance Search" functionality from Distance Education section to College Explorer section and renamed it to "Distance Education" for better organizational consistency. All institution-level analysis now consolidated under College Explorer (Summary, Federal Loans & Pell Grants, Graduation Rates, Distance Education). Removed method from Distance Education section, which now contains only aggregate trend charts (Top 25, Total Enrollment Trend, Exclusive DE Trend). | `src/sections/college_explorer.py`, `src/sections/distance_education.py`, `src/config/constants.py`, `src/config/__init__.py` |
| 2025-10-24 | Enhance Distance Education trend charts with stacked bar visualizations | Removed duplicate Year-over-Year Change legends from both trend charts. Added stacked bar charts underneath line charts for Total Enrollment Trend and Exclusive Distance Education Trend, providing market composition view complementing individual trajectory analysis. Replaced percentage line chart in Exclusive DE Trend with stacked bar. Fixed y-axis formatting from `.1s` to `~s` to eliminate duplicate labels and scientific notation, providing clean SI prefix labels (200k, 1M, 1.2M). Both charts now feature: line chart (trajectories + YoY changes), stacked bar chart (market composition), and data table (exact values). | `src/charts/distance_enrollment_trend_chart.py`, `src/charts/distance_de_trend_chart.py` |
| 2025-10-19 | Refine College Value Grid overview narrative | Annotated each quadrant directly within the illustrative grid, added adjacent callouts, removed redundant reading/how-to sections, and tuned typography/colors for clearer value framing. | `src/sections/value_grid.py` |
| 2025-10-19 | Normalize overview hero styling across sections | Darkened the landing page hero gradient and added an Earnings Premium & ROI focus bullet; replicated the streamlined hero block (icons, gradient, smaller typography, section-specific subtitles) across Value Grid, Federal Loans, Pell Grants, Distance Education, Earnings Premium, ROI, and College Explorer overviews for a consistent visual entry point. | `src/sections/overview.py`, `src/sections/value_grid.py`, `src/sections/federal_loans.py`, `src/sections/pell_grants.py`, `src/sections/distance_education.py`, `src/sections/earnings_premium.py`, `src/sections/roi.py`, `src/sections/college_explorer.py` |
