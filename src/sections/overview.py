            The EDU Accountability Lab delivers independent, data-driven analysis of
            higher education with a focus on accountability, affordability, and outcomes.
            Our audience includes policymakers, researchers, and taxpayers who seek greater transparency
            and effectiveness in postsecondary education. We take no advocacy position on specific
            institutions, programs, metrics, or policies. Our goal is to provide clear and well-documented
            methods that support policy discussions, strengthen institutional accountability,
            and improve public understanding of the value of higher education.

            - **Metrics for Accountability**: We are refining measures that capture affordability, completion, and post-graduation outcomes. These metrics are designed to make comparisons across institutions more transparent, reproducible, and useful for policymakers and researchers.

            - **Government Funding Analysis**: We are analyzing the flow of federal supportâ€”especially through student loans and Pell Grantsâ€”to better understand how public resources shape affordability and access. Tracking these funding streams alongside institutional outcomes provides a fuller picture of higher education's value and accountability.

            - **Earnings Premium & ROI**: We are building tools that compare post-graduation earnings to educational costs and aid profiles. These analyses surface institutions delivering strong wage gains relative to investment, helping stakeholders gauge long-term value across different student populations.

            - **Equity and Subgroup Outcomes**: We are examining how affordability, funding, and outcomes vary across student subgroups (e.g., income levels, race/ethnicity, first-generation status). Highlighting these differential impacts provides a more complete understanding of equity in higher education.
