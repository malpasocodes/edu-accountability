## Assertions Made in the Piece

- Community college campuses historically fostered rich social and cultural experiences (music events, flea markets, club days, sports).
- Since Covid-19, online enrollment expanded (NCES fall 2022: 58% of two-year students took at least one distance course; 31% fully online).
- Increased online participation is claimed to erode on-campus community and access to facilities/services.
- Online courses are presented as more flexible for working students but associated with lower academic outcomes and higher risks of academic dishonesty.
- Author cites personal experience as a youth employment counselor noting students who struggled with remote learning are skeptical of college and would benefit from hands-on, in-person programming.
- AI-driven labor market shifts heighten the value of hands-on fields offered by community colleges (e.g., De Anza’s nursing/automotive tracks, Central Oregon CC pre-apprenticeships).
- Concludes that while online courses are permanent, they cannot substitute for “three-dimensional” on-campus learning experiences.

## Potential Rebuttal Angles (for later development)

- **Data completeness:** Compare national trends with institution-specific outcomes (e.g., De Anza’s distance-ed participation vs. completion rates).
- **Hybrid models:** Highlight evidence of successful blended approaches or support services for online learners.
- **Access & equity:** Evaluate claims that online formats primarily dilute campus life versus expanding access for marginalized learners.
- **Student outcomes:** Examine research controlling for student demographics/intent that might counter the blanket assertion of lower online performance.
- **Economic reality:** Consider cost, commute, childcare, and employment needs that make online provision mission-critical for community colleges.
- **Labor market alignment:** Document how online/hybrid delivery is already integrated into workforce training (remote labs, simulations, partnerships).

These notes will be used to craft a detailed rebuttal in a future step.
