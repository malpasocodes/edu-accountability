# Data Strategy

This document outlines the data governance strategy for the College Accountability Dashboard, including principles, procedures, and guidelines for managing data throughout its lifecycle.

## Data Governance Principles

### 1. Transparency and Reproducibility
- All data sources are publicly documented with full provenance tracking
- Data transformations are explicitly documented and version-controlled
- Processing pipelines are reproducible and automated where possible
- Data lineage is maintained from source to final visualization

### 2. Quality and Reliability
- Data validation rules are enforced at ingestion and processing stages
- Quality issues are documented and communicated to users
- Multiple validation layers ensure data integrity
- Regular audits verify data accuracy and completeness

### 3. Accessibility and Usability
- Data dictionary provides comprehensive field-level documentation
- Human-readable documentation complements machine-readable schemas
- Clear data usage guidelines help users avoid common pitfalls
- Data formats are standardized and well-documented

### 4. Scalability and Maintainability
- Modular architecture supports adding new data sources
- Standardized metadata formats enable automation
- Version control tracks all changes to data and schemas
- Clear update procedures ensure consistent maintenance

```

### File Naming Conventions
- **Raw data**: Use original filenames when possible, organized by source
- **Processed data**: Descriptive names indicating content and scope
- **Metadata**: `metadata.yaml` in each source directory
- **Documentation**: Markdown format with descriptive names

## Data Source Management

### Adding New Data Sources

#### 1. Source Evaluation
Before adding a new data source, evaluate:
- **Authority**: Is the source authoritative and reliable?
- **Licensing**: Is the data publicly available and properly licensed?
- **Quality**: Does the source meet quality standards?
- **Relevance**: Does it align with dashboard objectives?
- **Maintenance**: Can updates be sustained over time?

#### 2. Integration Process
1. **Create source directory**: `data/raw/[source_name]/`
2. **Document source**: Create `metadata.yaml` with provenance information
3. **Update schema**: Add field definitions to `data/dictionary/schema.json`
4. **Update registry**: Add source information to `data/dictionary/sources.yaml`
5. **Create loader**: Implement data loading functions in `src/data/`
6. **Add validation**: Include quality checks and constraints
7. **Update documentation**: Modify `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`
8. **Test integration**: Verify data loads and validates correctly

#### 3. Required Metadata
Each new source must include:
- Provider organization and contact information
- Data collection methodology and frequency
- Variable definitions and coding schemes
- Known limitations and quality issues
- Licensing and usage restrictions
- Update schedule and procedures

### Data Source Priorities

#### Current Sources (Implemented)
1. **IPEDS** - Primary institutional data
2. **Federal Student Aid** - Pell grants and federal loans

#### Planned Sources (Priority Order)
1. **U.S. Census Bureau**
   - American Community Survey (employment outcomes by education)
   - County Business Patterns (local economic context)
   
2. **Bureau of Labor Statistics**
   - Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics
   - Consumer Price Index (for inflation adjustments)
   
3. **Department of Education**
   - College Scorecard (earnings outcomes)
   - Federal tax data (employment and earnings)

4. **State-Level Data**
   - State higher education agencies
   - Workforce development boards
   - Economic development authorities

## Data Quality Management

### Validation Framework

#### 1. Schema Validation
- Data types must match field definitions
- Required fields cannot be null
- Numeric ranges must fall within constraints
- Categorical values must match allowed values

#### 2. Business Rule Validation
- Cross-field relationships must be logical
- Time series data must be chronologically consistent
- Aggregated values must sum correctly
- Institutional identifiers must be valid

#### 3. Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: Percentage of non-null values
- **Consistency**: Agreement across related fields
- **Accuracy**: Validation against external sources
- **Timeliness**: Age of data relative to collection date

### Data Quality Reporting
- Automated quality reports generated with each data update
- Quality issues flagged in dashboard with user warnings
- Historical quality trends tracked over time
- Quality documentation updated with each release

## Update Procedures

### Regular Update Cycle

#### Quarterly Reviews (Every 3 Months)
1. **Check source updates**: Review IPEDS and FSA for new data releases
2. **Validate current data**: Run quality checks on existing datasets
3. **Update documentation**: Revise any outdated information
4. **Review user feedback**: Address reported data issues

#### Annual Updates (October/November)
1. **Major data refresh**: Download and integrate new IPEDS data
2. **Schema updates**: Modify field definitions as needed
3. **Historical validation**: Verify time series consistency
4. **Documentation review**: Comprehensive update of all documentation
5. **User communication**: Notify users of significant changes

### Emergency Updates
For critical data issues or corrections:
1. **Assess impact**: Determine scope and urgency of issue
2. **Implement fix**: Apply minimal necessary changes
3. **Validate fix**: Verify correction doesn't introduce new issues
4. **Document change**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Communicate**: Notify users of the correction

### Version Control
- All schema changes are versioned
- Data snapshots are tagged with download dates
- Processing pipeline changes are tracked in git
- Documentation updates are version-controlled

## Data Usage Guidelines

### Analytical Best Practices

#### 1. Data Preparation
- Always check for missing values before analysis
- Understand the source and limitations of each field
- Consider institutional context (size, sector, control)
- Apply appropriate filters for meaningful comparisons

#### 2. Time Series Analysis
- Account for policy changes affecting data collection
- Adjust financial data for inflation when appropriate
- Consider external events (economic cycles, regulatory changes)
- Use consistent cohorts for longitudinal analysis

#### 3. Comparative Analysis
- Compare institutions of similar characteristics
- Account for regional and demographic differences
- Consider selection bias in outcomes data
- Use appropriate statistical methods for the data type

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Mixing institutional types**: Comparing 2-year and 4-year institutions directly
- **Ignoring missing data**: Analyzing incomplete datasets without accounting for bias
- **Temporal misalignment**: Combining data from different academic years
- **Scale effects**: Not accounting for institutional size differences

## Privacy and Ethics

### Data Privacy
- All data used is publicly available and properly licensed
- No personally identifiable information is included
- Institutional data only includes aggregate measures
- Compliance with applicable data protection regulations

### Ethical Considerations
- Data is presented objectively without advocacy positions
- Limitations and uncertainties are clearly communicated
- Context is provided to prevent misinterpretation
- Methodology is transparent and reproducible

## Technology and Infrastructure

### Data Storage
- Raw data preserved in original format with metadata
- Processed data stored in efficient formats (Parquet, CSV)
- Version control for all data governance documents
- Regular backups of critical data and documentation

### Processing Pipeline
- Automated validation and quality checks
- Reproducible data transformations
- Error handling and logging
